        <h1>Configuring NGINX on AWS: A DevOps Case Study</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
            This case study documents the process of configuring an NGINX web server on an Ubuntu instance hosted on AWS. The objective was to deploy a functional web server capable of serving a custom HTML page. The exercise highlights key DevOps practices, including infrastructure provisioning, server configuration, and deployment automation.
        </p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            The task was executed in the following phases:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure Provisioning:</strong> An Ubuntu 22.04 LTS instance was launched on AWS EC2. The security group was configured to allow HTTP (port 80) and SSH (port 22) traffic.</li>
            <li><strong>Server Configuration:</strong> The instance was accessed via SSH using a private key (.pem file). NGINX was installed using the <code>apt</code> package manager, and the service was started and enabled for automatic startup on boot.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom HTML Deployment:</strong> The default NGINX HTML file (<code>/var/www/html/index.html</code>) was replaced with a custom page displaying the message: "Welcome to DevOps Stage 0 - [Your Name]/[SlackName]".</li>
            <li><strong>Validation:</strong> The web server was tested by accessing the instance’s public IP address in a browser. The custom HTML page was successfully served, confirming the configuration’s correctness.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
        <p>
            Several challenges were encountered during the process:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AWS EC2 Configuration:</strong> Initial unfamiliarity with AWS EC2 was addressed by referencing the official AWS documentation and tutorials.</li>
            <li><strong>SSH Connectivity:</strong> Permission issues with the private key were resolved by setting the correct file permissions using <code>chmod 400 &lt;key-file&gt;.pem</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>NGINX File Placement:</strong> Uncertainty about the default HTML file location was resolved by consulting the NGINX documentation, which indicated <code>/var/www/html/index.html</code> as the default path.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            This exercise demonstrated the foundational skills required for DevOps, including cloud infrastructure management, server configuration, and deployment automation. The successful deployment of a custom HTML page using NGINX on AWS EC2 underscores the importance of understanding both theoretical concepts and practical implementation in DevOps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Future work will focus on advanced topics such as infrastructure as code (IaC) using Terraform, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and containerization with Docker and Kubernetes.
